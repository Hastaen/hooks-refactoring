## Description

This repo contains 4 assignments. The assigments are to move from React class components to using React Hooks. The class components also contains tests. In order to complete a assignment the tests should succeed as well. This means that one might have to rewrite the tests in some cases.

## Things needed

Yarn -> download from official site.

Node -> A somewhat new version.

## Up and running

Run: `yarn` -> same as npm install

Run: `yarn test` -> runs test suite

Run: `yarn start` -> starts development server

## Assigments

### 1. Click Counter

`/components/simple-counter-button`

Refactor with Hooks.
Does the tests work?

### 2. Highlight List

`/components/highlight-list`

Refactor with Hooks.
What happened to the tests after a refactoring?

### 3. Simple Cool Table

`/components/simple-cool-table`


Refactor with Hooks.
How does one get access to previous props with Hooks?

### 4. Counter Button part 2

`/components/simple-counter-button-part-deux`


There are no tests. The goal is to refactor the functionality into a "Custom Hook". 
A custom Hook is a Hook or sets of Hooks which can be reused.

You will have to write tests from scratch....
